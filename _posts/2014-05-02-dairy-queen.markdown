I was inspired to recreate DQ's identity in a fresh way. I felt they need an revamp to their current look. My big idea was that Dairy Queen is a specialty ice cream parlor now and they when you would go to my Dairy Queen, you would treat yourself. I experimented with a lot of different materials and looks during the playing and creating process.
