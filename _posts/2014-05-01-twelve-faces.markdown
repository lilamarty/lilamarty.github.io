The goal of this project was to see if the negative connotation that is tied with fear could be changed and observed as creativity rather than something scary. The design deals with my everyday fears that are represented in the alarm clocks.

It has always been astonishing to me how our minds can create these irrational ideas, so I created irrational clocks with the guidance of Rick Valicenti from Thirst.
