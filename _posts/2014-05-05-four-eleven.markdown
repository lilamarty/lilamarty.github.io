Just like people, each secret has a story worth knowing. These memories are what have created me. The abstract rulers are my measurements, and my secrets. They are four feet eleven inches high and they represent my journey. Each ruler has itâ€™s own secret, and its own personality; the visuals in some shape or form construct the secrets.

This project illuminated different aspects of my life. It has also caused me to look at materials in a new way and to experiment and question as much as possible.
